<H1><A name=introduction></A>Introduction</H1>Your assignment will be to write a program that plays
<I>Konane</I>. Konane is an ancient Hawaiian board-game akin to checkers. It is
played on a rectangular board with tokens of two colours placed in a
checker-board pattern. Players alternate moving their pieces, jumping over and
removing their opponents pieces until one player is left without any valid
moves. 
<H1><A name=description></A>Game Description</H1>This section gives a
description of the rules of Konane as it will be played in this
competition. The game is a variant of Ancient Konane.
<p>The game is played on a rectangular board, which is divided into a grid of
squares (like a chessboard). The number of squares on the board will be varied
through the competition, but will consist of at least 49 squares arranged in a 7
x 7 pattern. Tokens of two colours (white and black, for simplicity) are
arranged on the board in a checker-board pattern with white at top left. For example, a 7 x 9 board
will contain 32 white tokens and 31 black tokens.</p>
<p> <a name="specific-formula"></a>Each player is randomly associated with a colour at the beginning of a game.
Then, the token at the centre and an adjoining token (of the other colour) is
removed to make moves possible. In this contest, the row and column number of
the removed tokens is determined as follows:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>middle row = (height - 1) / 2</code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>middle column 1 = (width - 1) / 2</code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>middle column 2 = middle column 1 + 1</code><br>
where row and column numbering begins with 0, <code>height</code> is the
number of rows, and <code>width</code> is the number of columns.</p>
<p>In Konane, players alternate making moves, with white beginning first. A
valid move consists of a player moving one of his tokens over an adjoining token
(of another colour) and placing it in the empty square just beyond and in the
same line. The opponent's token is then removed from the board. Every valid move
consists of at least one jump. Multiple jumps are allowed in a single move
provided that they occur in a straight line; L-shaped jump sequences are not
allowed. All tokens that have been jumped over are removed from the board.
Players are not allowed to &quot;advance&quot; their tokens as in chess or
checkers.</p>
<p>The first player to run out of valid moves loses. This may mean that a player
has lost all his tokens, or that the tokens are positioned so no valid move is possible. In this competition, players will also be allotted a
certain time to finish the game. A player who runs out of time before his
opponent does loses as well.</p>
<p>We suggest that you play the game by hand early on to familiarize yourself
with the rules of the game.</p>
<H1><A name=guidelines></A>Technical Guidelines</H1>
<h3><a name="development-tools"></a>Development Tools</h3>       
<p>The programming contest will be conducted entirely in the Java language.
Teams are free to use any development platform, but their solutions will
be expected to compile and run with the latest Java Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Enviroment (JRE) on Athena (v1.3.0); specifically, we will
be using IBM's high-performance Java compiler called jikes with Sun's 1.3
runtime libraries located in <code>&gt;jdkpath&lt;/jre/lib/rt.jar</code>
 to compile contest solutions. All solutions that compile using Sun's javac
compiler will also compile with jikes, but more quickly and efficiently.
More information regarding jikes can be found at
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project">
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project</a>.
We are also considering using IBM's JVM on Linux for the tournament,
pending more thorough testing. None of these decisions, however, will affect
your current development with Sun tools.</p>

<p>Also, the cksum utility in GNU textutils will be used to calculate
checksums of each team's source code. Hence, it is recommended that contestants
use Athena workstations for development if possible. To use JDK 1.3.0 on
Athena instead of the default 1.1.7, type the following at the shell prompt:
</p>

     <p><code>athena% add java<br>
     athena% setenv PATH /mit/java_v1.3.0/bin:$PATH</code></p>

<p>To use the jikes compiler, type the following at the shell prompt:</p>

     <p><code>athena% add jikes</code></p>

<p>and add the following to your classpath:</p>

     <p><code>/mit/java_v1.3.0/jre/rt.jar</code></p>

<p>The contest organizers have worked with Java on Linux,
Solaris, and Microsoft Windows. Sun's JDK and JRE can be downloaded for
Windows and Solaris from <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>.
The IBM's Sun-certified JDK 1.3 is available for Linux at
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/linux130/index.html">
http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/linux130/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>The source for textutils (which contains cksum), and other GNU tools
can be downloaded from <a href="ftp://aeneas.mit.edu">ftp://aeneas.mit.edu</a>
in the pub/gnu directory and compiled in a POSIX-compliant environment.
 In Microsoft operating systems,
Robert Ragno's port of cksum to Win32 is available from
<a href="file:///C:/My Documents/My Webs/homepage/ieee-teaser/cksum.exe">
http://web.mit.edu/ieee/iap/www/cksum.exe</a>. If you prefer to work in a 
POSIX-compliant environment within Windows, including standard GNU tools like
make, cvs, and cksum, we recommend the free Cygwin environment from Redhat
at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="package-overview"></a>Package
Overview</h3>       
<p>Teams will be provided with a downloadable Java archive file, <a href="#jar">konane.jar</a>, which contains the konaneCommon package:</p>
<table border="1" width="800">
  <tr>
    <td width="137">Konane</td>
    <td width="649">Container class of constants used in all game packages.
      White and black tokens are represented by public static final byte fields.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="137">BoardGrid</td>
    <td width="649">Class representing the Konane gameboard. Contains a rectangular array of token
      values and methods to validate positions, sides, moves, to return valid moves in the board, and to
      execute moves that will change the state of the board.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="137">Move</td>
    <td width="649">Class representing a move. It consists of a comment string,
      an initial position (x,y) and a final position (x,y).</td>

  </tr>
</table>
  <h3><a name="task-overview"></a>Task Overview</h3>       
<p>Every submission must contain a class named <code>Player</code> that extends
<code>konaneCommon.Player</code>. The constructor for the <code>Player</code>
class is the empty
constructor by default and accepts no parameters. If the <code>Player</code>
class needs
to perform initialization code, it should override the constructor but
should still accept zero parameters. The task of a team is to
override the <code>makeMove</code> method of <code>konaneCommon.Player</code>
&nbsp; to return a valid <code>Move</code> given two parameters:
an initial <code>BoardGrid</code> and a time limit in milliseconds.
<p>A Konane game is simulated by two <code>Player</code> objects that
alternate making <code>Moves</code> on a <code>BoardGrid</code>. Play
continues until one
<code>Player</code> object either runs out of moves,
runs out of time, or forfeits. A Player may forfeit by returning
a <code>Move</code> object with the comment value set to
 <code>**FORFEIT**</code>.
 <b>The return of
an illegal move will be interpreted as a programming error and will cause an
immediate forfeit of the game.</b></p>
<p>The submission requirements are listed below and are elaborated in the
 <a href="#detailed-specs">Detailed Requirements</a> and in
  <a href="readme.txt">readme.txt</a> in the Java archive.</p>

<ol type="1)">
<li>The team submission should define a package with a unique name of the
    form <em><code>&lt;teamname&gt;</code>_xx</em> where
    <em><code>&lt;teamname&gt;</code></em> is any string of 22 or less
    characters chosen from [a-z,A-z,0-9] and <em><code>xx</code></em> is
    the number assigned to each team upon registration. Each team's contact
    person should e-mail their package name to the contest organizers at
    <a href="mailto:6370@mit.edu">6370@mit.edu</a> as soon as possible.
<li>The team package should include a class named Player that extends
    konaneCommon.Player.
<li>The Player class should override the Player.makeMove method, which is the
    entry point into team-written code.
<li>The team-written source code should not define any new threads of execution.
<li>The team-written source code should not interface with non-Java code,
    compiled native libraries, precompiled Java bytecode, or any Java
    code not written by the team explicitly for this particular contest, with
    the exception of the <code>BoardGrid</code>, <code>Move</code>,
    <code>Konane</code>, and <code>Player</code> classes in the
    <code>konaneCommon package</code>, and the standard runtime classes in
    jre/lib/rt.jar of Sun's JDK 1.3.
    Use of Java's Reflection classes, use of Class methods to access classes
    not written by the team, file system operations, or network operations
    is not allowed.
<li>Team submissions should consist of team-written source code in a
    jar file named after the team and a checksum of the source files. Teams
    should send their jar file and checksum as e-mail attachment to
    <a href="mailto:6370@mit.edu">6370@mit.edu</a> by the contest deadlines listed earlier in this document.

<H2><A name=guest-lecture></A>Guest Lecture (January 17th)</H2>Prof.
Michael Ernst will give a <a href="konane.pdf"> lecture</a> on Combinatorial
Game Theory based on his previous work with Konane. The lecture will be from 1-2 pm in room 4-370. A listing of Prof. Ernst's publications can be found at <a href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/">http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/</a>.<p>Criteria for acceptance/elimination of submissions at the
preliminary rounds will be refined at this date.</p>
<H2><A name=preliminary-rounds></A>Preliminary Rounds (January 21st)</H2>Teams will turn in
submissions which will be privately played
against one another. All submissions will be required to be fundamentally
functional by this date, ie. they are <b> required</b> not to return an illegal move over
the course of the test tournament. Seedings for the final phase of the
competition will be determined at this stage. The best two submissions at this
stage will be obfuscated, compiled and made available to all teams to benchmark
against.
<p>The submission deadline is 9 AM, 21st January 2001. The technical details of
submission are to be found in Section 4 of the <a href="README.txt">detailed
requirements</a>.</p>
<p>The top two submissions will also receive byes in the elimination rounds. Submissions that are invalid and/or do not demonstrate adequate progress at this stage may be eliminated from the competition at the discretion
of the organizers.</p>
<H2><A name=qualifying-rounds></A>Qualifying Rounds (January 27th-29th)</H2>Submissions
will be compiled, and then played against one another automatically. Contestants
are free to inspect the process. We will begin a process of elimination of
teams to reduce the field to eight teams for the final live contest on January
30th.
<p>The format of the qualifying rounds is still being worked on. This
information will be posted here as soon as it is decided.</p>

<H1><A name=what-we-give-you></A>What We Give You</H1>
<p>Each team is provided with this document, which is a printable record of
the rules of Konane, the submission requirements, the contest schedule and
other essential information. Teams are also provided with a downloadable jar
file, <a href="#jar">konane.jar</a> which contains the following.</p>       
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>A common package of Konane classes (<code>konaneCommon</code>),
         along with Javadoc-generated HTML documentation, that should be used
	  in writing a submission.
    <li>A trivial reference implementation to serve as an example and
     	against which team submissions can be tested.
    <li>A test program to play two implementations against each other.
